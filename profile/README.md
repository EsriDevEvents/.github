Each year there are two Esri Developer Summits: [Esri Developer Summit](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/overview) (US-based 🇺🇸) & [Esri European Developer Summit](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/) (🇪🇺).

This organization contains repositories with code samples 💻, snippets, and slides voluntarily shared by the speakers.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/esridevsummit/.github/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) if you notice any missing resources, and we will attempt to have the content uploaded.

Some sessions are recorded 🎥 and uploaded to [Esri Mediaspace](https://mediaspace.esri.com/category/Esri+Developer+Summit/244321192). While slides 📚 are uploaded to [Esri Conference Proceedings](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/index/proceedings) (previously [proceedings.esri.com](https://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/index.html))
